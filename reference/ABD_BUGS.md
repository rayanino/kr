## Code Bugs (Functional)

### BUG-001 🔴 FIXED — Taxonomy Format Divergence Breaks Leaf Extraction for بلاغة

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `extract_taxonomy_leaves()` (line 911)

**Problem:**
`extract_taxonomy_leaves()` scans for `_leaf: true` via line-by-line text matching. The إملاء taxonomy uses `_leaf: true` in a nested-dict YAML structure — this works. The بلاغة taxonomy uses `leaf: true` (no underscore) in a list-of-nodes structure with explicit `id` fields. Result: **0 leaves returned** for بلاغة (expected: 143). Every excerpt placement triggers a "non-leaf" validation warning and the retry loop can never succeed.

**Verified:** Audit 2 confirmed function is unchanged.

```python
from tools.extract_passages import extract_taxonomy_leaves
with open('taxonomy/balagha/balagha_v0_4.yaml') as f:
    print(len(extract_taxonomy_leaves(f.read())))  # → 0
```

**Impact:** Extraction pipeline is completely broken for any science using the list-based taxonomy format.

**Fix:** Parse YAML properly (not line scanning). Handle both `_leaf: true` and `leaf: true` in both dict and list structures.

---

### BUG-002 🔴 FIXED — `prose_tail` Atom Type Missing from VALID_ATOM_TYPES

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `VALID_ATOM_TYPES` constant + `post_process_extraction()`

**Problem:**
When the LLM returns `"type": "prose_tail"` (which it sometimes does despite prompt instructions), `post_process_extraction()` renames it to `atom_type: "prose_tail"` but sets `is_prose_tail: False` via `setdefault`. Validation then fires two contradictory errors: invalid atom_type WARNING + uncovered atom ERROR. The retry loop sends both back to the LLM, which gets confused.

**Verified:** Audit 2 confirmed `VALID_ATOM_TYPES` still equals `{'prose_sentence', 'bonded_cluster', 'quran_quote_standalone', 'list_item', 'heading', 'verse_evidence'}`.

**Impact:** Unnecessary retries (~$0.03–0.10 per passage) on every passage with continuation text.

**Fix:** In `post_process_extraction()`, detect `atom_type == "prose_tail"` → set `is_prose_tail = True` and change `atom_type` to `"prose_sentence"`.

---

### BUG-003 🔴 FIXED — Committed Extraction Output Is Stale (Pre-Post-Processing)

**Location:** `output/imlaa_extraction/P004_extraction.json`, `P010_extraction.json`

**Problem:**
Committed extraction outputs predate the current `post_process_extraction()` code. They use `type` instead of `atom_type`, and are missing `record_type`, `book_id`, `source_layer`, `is_prose_tail`, `bonded_cluster_trigger`, `exclusions`, and `notes`. Additionally, these files are tracked in git despite `output/` being in `.gitignore` (force-added before the gitignore rule existed).

**Verified:** Audit 2 confirmed: `P004_extraction.json` atoms have keys `['atom_id', 'note', 'role', 'text', 'type']` — missing all post-processing fields. Excerpts are missing `case_types`, `relations`, `book_id`, `record_type`, `status`, `taxonomy_version`, and 15+ other schema-required fields.

**Impact:** Anyone treating committed output as reference data gets a wrong picture of the tool's current output format.

**Fix:** Either re-run extraction and recommit, or `git rm` the stale files and add a note that `output/` is gitignored.

---

### BUG-004 🔴 FIXED — `book_id` Inconsistency Across Pipeline Stages

**Location:** Cross-cutting: registry, intake, Stage 1, Stage 2, extraction

**Problem:**
The same book uses three different IDs:

| Source | `book_id` |
|--------|-----------|
| `books/books_registry.yaml` | `imla` |
| `books/imla/intake_metadata.json` | `imla` |
| `books/imla/stage1_output/pages.jsonl` | `qawaid_imlaa` |
| `books/imla/stage2_output/passages.jsonl` | `qawaid_imlaa` |
| `output/imlaa_extraction/extraction_summary.json` | `qimlaa` |
| Atom ID prefix in extraction | `qimlaa:matn:...` |

**Verified:** Audit 2 confirmed all three IDs still present.

**Impact:** Cross-stage joins on `book_id` silently miss data.

**Fix:** Enforce single canonical book_id from Stage 0 intake metadata; propagate automatically to downstream stages.

---

### BUG-005 🟡 FIXED — Footnote Preamble Silently Dropped in Extraction

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `get_passage_footnotes()` (line ~418)

**Problem:**
`get_passage_footnotes()` collects only the structured `footnotes` array (numbered entries). It ignores the `footnote_preamble` field entirely. For pages with `footnote_section_format: "bare_number"` or `"unnumbered"`, the ENTIRE footnote content is captured as preamble, so ALL footnote content on those pages is silently dropped.

**Verified:** Audit 2 confirmed function unchanged — still only reads `pg.get("footnotes", [])`, no mention of `footnote_preamble`.

**Fix:** Include `footnote_preamble` content in the footnote text sent to the LLM.

---

### BUG-014 🟡 FIXED — Gold Schema `divisions_schema_v0.1.json` Has Empty Division Item Definition

**Location:** `schemas/divisions_schema_v0.1.json`

**Problem:**
Division item schema has `"required": [], "properties": {}` — any object passes validation.

**Fix:** Schema now has full `division_node` definition with 12 required fields and 22 properties including `additionalProperties: false`.

---

## Documentation Bugs (Introduced or Persisted After Docs Rewrite)

### BUG-021 🔴 FIXED — EXCERPTING_SPEC §4.2 Relation Types Are Completely Fabricated

**Location:** `4_excerpting/EXCERPTING_SPEC.md` §4.2 (line ~134)

**Problem:**
The spec lists 5 relation types: `prerequisite`, `builds_on`, `contrasts`, `exemplifies`, `cross_reference`. **None of these exist in the actual schema.** The real 13 relation types (from `schemas/gold_standard_schema_v0.3.3.json` and `project_glossary.md` §7) are: `footnote_supports`, `footnote_explains`, `footnote_citation_only`, `footnote_source`, `split_continues_in`, `split_continued_from`, `shared_shahid`, `exercise_tests`, `interwoven_sibling`, `cross_layer`, `has_overview`, `answers_exercise_item`, `belongs_to_exercise_set`.

Zero overlap between the spec's types and the actual types.

**Impact:** Anyone implementing excerpting from this spec would produce invalid relation types that fail schema validation. The REPO_MAP §Known Schema Drift already warns about specs vs gold, but this is a complete fabrication, not a drift.

**Fix:** Replaced §4.2 fabricated types with cross-reference to `project_glossary.md` §7, listing all 13 real relation types by category. Added schema drift warning banner at top of file.

---

### BUG-022 🔴 FIXED — EXCERPTING_SPEC §5.2 Excerpt Example Uses Wrong Field Names and ID Format

**Location:** `4_excerpting/EXCERPTING_SPEC.md` §5.2 (line ~173)

**Problem:**
The example excerpt JSON uses:
- `"excerpt_id": "EXC_001"` — should be `{book_id}:exc:000001` format
- `"placed_at": "balagha/..."` — field doesn't exist; schema uses `taxonomy_node_id`
- `"atoms": [{atom_id, role}]` flat array — schema uses separate `core_atoms[]` and `context_atoms[]`
- Missing 14+ required schema fields (`book_id`, `record_type`, `status`, `taxonomy_version`, `heading_path`, `boundary_reasoning`, `case_types`, etc.)

**Impact:** Example is misleading; extraction code implementing this example would produce invalid output.

**Fix:** Replaced incorrect example with field reference list pointing to `schemas/gold_standard_schema_v0.3.3.json` and `project_glossary.md` §4–§5, using correct field names and ID format.

---

### BUG-023 🔴 FIXED — ATOMIZATION_SPEC §5 Atom Example Uses All Wrong Field Names

**Location:** `3_atomization/ATOMIZATION_SPEC.md` §5 (line ~100)

**Problem:**
Despite being marked "SUPERSEDED", this spec is still listed in CLAUDE.md §Key Files and REPO_MAP as a reference. Its example atom uses:
- `"atom_id": "A001"` → should be `{book_id}:{layer}:{6-digit}` (e.g., `jawahir:matn:000004`)
- `"text_ar"` → schema says `text`
- `"source_page"` → schema says `page_hint` (optional)
- `"source_locator"` → schema says `source_anchor` (required)
- `"is_heading"` → schema uses `atom_type` enum (heading is a value, not a boolean)
- `"bond_group"` / `"bond_reason"` → schema uses `bonded_cluster_trigger` (structured object)

Every single field name is wrong relative to the gold schema v0.3.3.

**Impact:** Although marked superseded, the spec is still referenced. Any reader following the field names will produce schema-invalid output.

**Fix:** Replaced §5 atom properties table and §4.2 LLM output example with correct field names from `schemas/gold_standard_schema_v0.3.3.json`. Spec already marked SUPERSEDED at top.

---

### BUG-024 🟡 FIXED — TAXONOMY_SPEC Uses Wrong Field Names and ID Formats

**Location:** `5_taxonomy/TAXONOMY_SPEC.md` §4.1, §4.2

**Problem:**
- §4.1: Uses `placed_at` field — schema uses `taxonomy_node_id`
- §4.2: Uses `"triggered_by_excerpt": "EXC_042"` — actual format is `{book_id}:exc:000042`
- §4.2: `taxonomy_change` example is plausible but doesn't match the schema's `taxonomy_change_record` definition (missing `record_type`, using wrong field names)

**Fix:** Added schema drift warning banner at top of file. Updated §3 "Current state" to reflect all 5 sciences. Fixed excerpt ID format in §4.2 example.

---

### BUG-025 🟡 FIXED — RUNBOOK Default Model Claim Doesn't Match Code

**Location:** `3_extraction/RUNBOOK.md` line 109

**Problem:**
RUNBOOK says: `--model MODEL — Claude model to use (default: claude-sonnet-4-20250514)`
Actual code default (extract_passages.py line 1367): `default="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`

The RUNBOOK was updated in PR #8 but the model default was not corrected to match the code.

**Fix:** RUNBOOK already updated to say `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`.

---

### BUG-026 🟡 FIXED — RUNBOOK Extraction JSON Description Doesn't Match Committed Output

**Location:** `3_extraction/RUNBOOK.md` §"Extraction JSON structure" (line ~155)

**Problem:**
RUNBOOK claims extraction JSON contains:
- `case_types[]` — committed output has `content_type` instead, no `case_types`
- `relations[]` — committed output has no `relations` field
- `exclusions[]` — committed output has no `exclusions` key
- `notes` — committed output has no `notes` key

The RUNBOOK describes the *intended* post-processed output format, but the committed P004/P010 files are pre-post-processing (see BUG-003). This creates confusion: docs describe one format, committed data shows another.

**Fix:** RUNBOOK extraction JSON description updated to match actual post-processed output format. Stale committed output files untracked.

---

### BUG-027 🟡 FIXED — CLAUDE.md Test Count Is Wrong

**Location:** `CLAUDE.md` line 145

**Problem:**
CLAUDE.md says `# Unit tests (463 pass, ~9s)`. Actual result: `469 passed, 7 skipped in 11.99s`.

**Fix:** CLAUDE.md test count updated to 940+ across 10 test files.

---

### BUG-028 🟡 FIXED — REPO_MAP Line Counts and Test Totals Are Wrong

**Location:** `REPO_MAP.md` §Tools, §Tests

**Problem:**

| Item | REPO_MAP claims | Actual |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `tools/discover_structure.py` | ~1400 lines | 2856 lines |
| Test total | 3602 lines | 5042 lines |
| `test_structure_discovery.py` lines | — (blank) | 1440 lines |
| `test_structure_discovery.py` tests | — (blank) | 86 tests |

The `discover_structure.py` line count is off by 2x — likely the tool was significantly expanded after REPO_MAP was written. The test lines total is also 40% wrong because `test_structure_discovery.py` was omitted from the count.

Additionally, REPO_MAP is missing 4 tools entirely:
- `tools/check_env.py` (163 lines)
- `tools/checkpoint_index_lib.py` (203 lines)
- `tools/generate_checkpoint_index.py` (32 lines)
- `tools/validate_structure.py` (318 lines)

**Fix:** REPO_MAP line counts and test totals updated. Missing tools added.

---

### BUG-029 🟡 FIXED — Taxonomy Registry Missing إملاء Entry

**Location:** `taxonomy/taxonomy_registry.yaml`

**Problem:**
The registry only lists بلاغة versions (balagha_v0_2 through v0_4). `imlaa_v0.1` is completely absent despite being the only taxonomy actively used in extraction. CLAUDE.md says "taxonomy/imlaa_v0.1.yaml — إملاء taxonomy (44 leaves)" and the extraction tool uses it, but the "canonical registry" doesn't know it exists.

**Impact:** Any code that resolves taxonomies through the registry (as REPO_MAP instructs: "The production pipeline MUST resolve taxonomy trees through this registry") will find no إملاء tree.

**Fix:** Registry now has imlaa entries (imlaa_v0_1 historical + imlaa_v1_0 active), plus nahw and sarf entries.

---

### BUG-030 🟡 FIXED — CLAUDE.md "What Needs to Be Built" Lists بلاغة Tree as Missing

**Location:** `CLAUDE.md` line 252

**Problem:**
Line 252 says: *"Taxonomy trees for صرف, نحو, بلاغة (base outlines to be provided, then evolve with books)"*
But بلاغة already has a 143-leaf taxonomy tree (balagha_v0_4.yaml), actively used by gold baselines. Line 214 correctly says only "صرف and نحو trees: not yet created."

This is contradictory within the same file. The "What needs to be built" list is misleading.

**Fix:** CLAUDE.md "What needs to be built" list updated — all 4 core science trees now listed as complete.

---

## Repo Hygiene / Data Issues

### BUG-031 🟡 FIXED — `output/` Files Tracked in Git Despite `.gitignore` Rule

**Location:** `.gitignore` + `output/imlaa_extraction/`

**Problem:**
`.gitignore` has `output/` but `git ls-files output/` shows 5 tracked files (P004/P010 extraction + reviews + summary). These were force-added before the gitignore rule was created. Git continues tracking them, so `git status` won't flag them as untracked, and `git diff` will show changes if they're modified.

**Impact:** Confusing: gitignore says "don't track output" but git tracks output. New contributors may not realize these files are stale artifacts.

**Fix:** Stale output files untracked from git.

---

### BUG-032 🟡 FIXED — 4 Old Normalization Spec Versions Cluttering `1_normalization/`

**Location:** `1_normalization/`

**Problem:**
Five normalization spec files exist: `NORMALIZATION_SPEC.md` (unnumbered), `_v0.2.md`, `_v0.3.md`, `_v0.4.md`, `_v0.5.md`. Only v0.5 is current. The other four are superseded. Unlike `archive/precision_deprecated/` (which has a `DO_NOT_READ.md` warning), these old specs sit alongside the current one with no warning.

**Impact:** A reader may accidentally read v0.3 or v0.4 instead of v0.5 and follow outdated rules.

**Fix:** Moved old versions (unnumbered, v0.2, v0.3, v0.4) to `archive/normalization_specs/`.

---

### BUG-033 🟢 FIXED — `jawahir_normalized.jsonl` Is an Empty File (0 bytes)

**Location:** `1_normalization/jawahir_normalized.jsonl`

**Problem:**
This file is 0 bytes — completely empty. Its sibling `jawahir_normalized_full.jsonl` (144KB) has content. The empty file appears to be an aborted run or a mistake. Both files are in a spec directory, not a data output directory.

**Fix:** Empty file deleted from repository.

---

### BUG-034 🟢 FIXED — Stale Analysis Reports in `1_normalization/`

**Location:** `1_normalization/STAGE1_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `STAGE1_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS.md`, `STAGE1_ROUND2_ANALYSIS.md`

**Problem:**
These are one-time analysis documents from Stage 1 development. They reference specific bugs and findings that may have been fixed. They sit alongside active specs without any staleness indicator.

**Impact:** Low — useful as historical reference, but a new reader might treat findings as current issues.

**Fix:** Moved all three reports to `archive/normalization_analysis/`.

---

## Previously Reported (Status Updates)

### BUG-006 🟡 FIXED — ZWNJ Heading Signal Wasted in Extraction

**Fix:** Added `get_heading_hints()` function that extracts ZWNJ-marked heading lines from passage pages. Integrated into extraction prompt as `{heading_hints_section}` — when headings are detected, the LLM receives structured hints to assign `atom_type='heading'` correctly. 8 tests added.

### BUG-007 🟡 CLOSED (BY DESIGN) — Schema Drift Between Gold v0.3.3 and Extraction Output

**Resolution:** The gold schema v0.3.3 is a **union schema** documenting all fields across the full pipeline lifecycle (extraction → consensus → assembly → distribution). Each stage produces a stage-appropriate subset. Extraction outputs 21/34 excerpt fields and 8/17 atom fields — the remaining fields are added by downstream stages (assembly adds `scholarly_context`, `heading_path`, `content_summary`; distribution adds folder placement metadata). This is intentional stage-specific design, not drift. The REPO_MAP §Known Schema Drift already documents this correctly.

### BUG-008 🟡 FIXED — Page Filter May Miss Pages Due to seq_index Gaps

**Fix:** Changed `page_by_seq` construction from dict comprehension to explicit loop that detects and warns on duplicate `seq_index` values in `pages.jsonl`.

### BUG-009 🟡 FIXED — `discover_structure.py` Uses Sonnet 4 While `extract_passages.py` Uses Sonnet 4.5

**Fix:** Updated `discover_structure.py` `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, matching `extract_passages.py`.

### BUG-010 🟢 FIXED — Hardcoded Sonnet 3.5 Cost Calculation in `extract_passages.py`

**Fix:** Cost calculation now uses `MODEL_PRICING` dict with per-model rates. `get_model_cost()` dynamically looks up pricing.

### BUG-011 🟢 FIXED — Empty/Duplicate Files in Repository

**Fix:** Removed `5_taxonomy/ZOOM_BRIEF.md` (0 bytes, empty placeholder). Gold baseline empty `.stderr.txt`/`.stdout.txt` files are intentional artifacts (recording that steps had no output) and were retained.

### BUG-012 🟡 FIXED — `requirements.txt` Missing `httpx` Dependency

**Fix:** Added `httpx>=0.24.0` to `requirements.txt`.

### BUG-013 🟡 FIXED — Normalization Default Output Path Mismatch

**Fix:** Changed `_run_book_id_mode()` default output path from `books/{book_id}/pages.jsonl` to `books/{book_id}/stage1_output/pages.jsonl`, matching the actual convention.

### BUG-015 🟢 FIXED — Cost Comment References Wrong Model

**Fix:** Resolved by MODEL_PRICING dict implementation (same fix as BUG-010).

### BUG-016 🟢 FIXED — `jawahir_normalization_report.json` Uses Older Report Schema

**Fix:** Removed the stale `1_normalization/jawahir_normalization_report.json` (old 11-field flat schema). The current-schema version already exists at `1_normalization/gold_samples/jawahir_normalization_report.json` (21+ fields with nested `volumes` structure).

### BUG-017 🟢 ~~OPEN~~ NOT A BUG — ~~Duplicate~~ `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` in `discover_structure.py`

**False positive.** `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` is defined exactly once (line 704) and used once (line 722 as default argument). There is no duplication. The original audit's "grep confirms two identical definitions" claim was incorrect — grep found the definition and the usage, not two definitions.

### BUG-018 🟢 FIXED — Mixed HTTP Clients (`anthropic` SDK vs raw `httpx`)

**Fix:** Converted `enrich.py` and `discover_structure.py` from `anthropic` SDK to raw `httpx`, matching the pattern in `extract_passages.py`. The `anthropic` package is no longer imported anywhere in the codebase. Only `httpx` (the declared dependency in `requirements.txt`) is used for all API calls.

### BUG-019 🟢 CLOSED (NOT A BUG) — Page 0 Not Explicitly Excluded from Structure Discovery

**Investigation:** Page 0 (seq_index=0) contains book metadata (title, author, publisher) with `page_number: None`. Structure discovery implicitly skips it because headings are discovered from HTML tags on content pages starting at seq_index=1. Verified on imla (P001 starts at seq_index=1) and wasitiyyah. No explicit guard needed — the existing behavior is correct.

### BUG-020 🟢 CLOSED (BY DESIGN) — Gold Baselines vs Extraction Tool Use Different Output Formats

**Resolution:** Same root cause as BUG-007. Gold baselines (بلاغة, hand-crafted) use the full union schema v0.3.3 with all 34 excerpt fields. Extraction tool produces stage-appropriate output with 21 fields — downstream stages (assembly, distribution) add the remaining fields. The gold baselines serve as end-state reference for the fully-assembled output, not as extraction-stage output targets.

---

## New Fixes (Audit 3 — 2026-02-28)

### BUG-035 🔴 FIXED — Validation Missed Duplicate Atom IDs

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()`

**Problem:** No check for duplicate atom_id values within a passage. If the LLM produces two atoms with the same ID, both pass validation silently.

**Fix:** Added Check 2b: duplicate atom_id detection.

---

### BUG-036 🔴 FIXED — Ghost Atom References Counted as Coverage

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()` Check 6

**Problem:** `covered_atoms.add(aid)` was called unconditionally for every atom reference in excerpts, even when the referenced atom didn't exist in the atoms list. This meant ghost references inflated the coverage count, potentially hiding uncovered atoms.

**Fix:** Only count atoms that actually exist: `elif aid: covered_atoms.add(aid)`.

---

### BUG-037 🟡 FIXED — Empty core_atoms Passed Validation

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()` Check 5

**Problem:** An excerpt with `"core_atoms": []` (empty list) passed all validation checks despite being semantically invalid — an excerpt must contain at least one atom.

**Fix:** Added Check 5b: empty core_atoms detection.

---

### BUG-038 🔴 FIXED — Evolution Engine Included Invalid Node IDs in Proposals

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `propose_evolution_for_signal()`

**Problem:** When the LLM proposed new node IDs that failed validation (uppercase, spaces, Arabic characters, duplicates), the invalid nodes were flagged with a warning but still included in the proposal's `validated_nodes` list. This meant invalid IDs could propagate to the taxonomy.

**Fix:** Invalid nodes are now excluded from `validated_nodes` and added to `rejected_nodes`. If all nodes are invalid, the function returns `None`. If some are invalid, confidence is downgraded to `"uncertain"`.

---

### BUG-039 🟡 FIXED — Cluster Signals Not Book-Aware

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `scan_cluster_signals()`

**Problem:** Cluster detection keyed on `node_id` alone, not `(book_id, node_id)`. This meant excerpts from *different* books at the same leaf incorrectly triggered a "same_book_cluster" evolution signal. Multiple books contributing to the same leaf is expected behavior, not an evolution trigger.

**Fix:** Cluster detection now groups by `(book_id, node_id)`. Only multiple excerpts from the same book at the same node trigger a signal.

---

### BUG-040 🔴 FIXED — VALID_SCIENCES Hardcoded Blocks New Sciences

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` line 45, `tools/intake.py` line 31

**Problem:** `VALID_SCIENCES = {"imlaa", "sarf", "nahw", "balagha"}` was enforced at runtime. Any attempt to process a new science (fiqh, hadith, عقيدة, etc.) was rejected immediately. The engine is architecturally science-agnostic, but this validation blocked extensibility.

**Fix:** Renamed to `KNOWN_SCIENCES` (informational), changed from hard error to warning. Removed `choices=` restriction from intake.py's argparse. Updated help text across all tools to show open-ended science names.

---

### BUG-041 🔴 FIXED — `_resolve_key_for_model(None)` Crashes Consensus

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `_resolve_key_for_model()` (line 884)

**Problem:** When no `--arbiter-model` is specified, `arbiter_model` is `None`. The consensus code passes `None` to `_resolve_key_for_model()`, which calls `_is_openai_model(None)`, triggering `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'`. This crashes every multi-model consensus run that doesn't explicitly set an arbiter.

**Fix:** Added `if not model: return anthropic_key or ""` guard at top of `_resolve_key_for_model()`.

---

### BUG-042 🔴 FIXED — Intake Rejects New Science Names

**Location:** `tools/intake.py` → book category determination (line 1214)

**Problem:** After `validate_science()` accepts a new science name (e.g., `aqidah`), the book category determination code only recognized `SINGLE_SCIENCES` (the 4 core sciences) and fell through to `abort("Unexpected science value")`. Result: intake blocked for any non-core science despite the engine being architecturally science-agnostic.

**Fix:** Reversed the if-elif chain so any specific science name (not `multi`/`adjacent`/`unrelated`) is treated as `single_science`. Non-core sciences get an informational note.

---

### BUG-043 🔴 FIXED — LLM Returns Full Taxonomy Paths Instead of Leaf IDs

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()` Check 10

**Problem:** When presented with hierarchical taxonomy YAML, LLMs (both Claude and GPT-4o) frequently return full dot-paths (e.g., `aqidah.al_iman_billah.asma_wa_sifat.al_istiwa`), colon-paths (`manhaj_ahl_al_sunna:al_ittiba3`), or slash-paths instead of just the leaf node ID (`al_istiwa`). The validation correctly flagged these as "non-leaf" but the retry loop couldn't fix it — the LLM keeps returning paths. This caused persistent warnings and wasted retry budget across all عقيدة passages.

**Fix:** Added a normalization step before leaf validation: if a taxonomy_node_id contains `.`, `:`, or `/` separators, extract the last segment and check if it's a valid leaf. If so, normalize in-place. Unknown paths still produce warnings.

---

### BUG-044 🟡 FIXED — Evolution Engine Blind Spot: Category-Name Leaves

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → signal detection

**Problem:** The evolution engine only detected granularity problems via `same_book_cluster` (2+ excerpts from same book at same node) and `unmapped` signals. It had no mechanism to detect leaf nodes whose names indicate they are **categories/collections** (e.g., الصفات الذاتية, مراتب القدر) rather than specific topics. These leaf nodes should be branches with sub-leaves for individual items. With عقيدة v0.1, `sifat_dhatiyyah`, `sifat_fi3liyyah`, and `maratib_al_qadr` were all flat leaves — a significant granularity failure. The engine would never flag these unless multiple excerpts happened to land there.

**Fix:** Added `scan_category_leaf_signals()` — a keyword-based scanner that checks leaf node labels (Arabic) and IDs (Latin transliteration) against a curated list of 20 category/plural keywords (مراتب, أقسام, أنواع, صفات, أحكام, شروط, أركان, etc.). Fires regardless of excerpt count — the name itself is the signal. Integrated into `run_evolution()` with `--skip-category-check` CLI flag. Added 8 tests.

**Verified:** Dry-run on عقيدة v0.1 correctly detects 4 category-leaf signals: `sifat_dhatiyyah`, `sifat_fi3liyyah`, `manhaj_ahl_al_sunna_fi_al_sifat`, `maratib_al_qadr`.

---

### BUG-045 🟡 FIXED — Evolution Engine Blind Spot: Solo Multi-Topic Excerpts

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → signal detection

**Problem:** When a single large excerpt (many atoms) is the only excerpt at a leaf node, the engine has no signal to fire — `same_book_cluster` requires 2+, and `unmapped` only catches unplaced excerpts. This means a 5-atom mega-excerpt covering 15 different divine attributes at `sifat_fi3liyyah` goes undetected. The excerpt is "placed correctly" from the engine's perspective, but the node desperately needs granulation.

**Fix:** Added `scan_multi_topic_signals()` — detects nodes with exactly 1 matn excerpt that has ≥4 core atoms. This heuristic flags excerpts likely covering multiple sub-topics. Footnote excerpts are excluded from the count. Configurable threshold via `min_atoms` parameter. Integrated into `run_evolution()` with `--skip-multi-topic` CLI flag. Added 6 tests.

**Verified:** Dry-run on عقيدة v0.1 correctly detects 2 multi-topic signals: the 9-atom excerpt at `manhaj_ahl_al_sunna_fi_al_sifat` and the 5-atom excerpt at `sifat_fi3liyyah`.

### BUG-046 🟡 FIXED — عقيدة Test Taxonomy v0.1 Has Flat Leaves for Categories

**Location:** `taxonomy/aqidah/aqidah_v0_1.yaml`

**Problem:** The عقيدة v0.1 test taxonomy was manually created (not LLM-generated like the 4 core science trees). It treated الصفات الذاتية, الصفات الفعلية, and مراتب القدر as leaf endpoints, but these are category/collection names that should be branches with sub-leaves for individual topics (individual attributes, individual مراتب, etc.).

**Fix:** Created `taxonomy/aqidah/aqidah_v0_2.yaml` with proper branch/leaf structure:
- `sifat_dhatiyyah` → branch with 5 leaves: `al_ma3iyyah`, `al_wajh`, `al_yadayn`, `al_ayn`, `__overview`
- `sifat_fi3liyyah` → branch with 5 leaves: `al_nuzul`, `al_dahik_wal_farah_wal_ajab`, `al_ghadab_wal_rida`, `al_istiwa`, `__overview`
- `maratib_al_qadr` → branch with 3 leaves: `al_ilm_wal_kitabah`, `al_mashia_wal_qudrah`, `mawqif_al_firaq_min_al_qadr`

**Note:** Existing extraction data was created against v0.1 leaves. Re-assembly with v0.2 places excerpts at the now-branch folders (correct intermediate state). Full redistribution to sub-leaves would require re-extraction or a redistribution step.

---

### BUG-047 🔴 FIXED — Rollback Manifest Doubled Parent Node Path

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → rollback manifest generation (line ~1864)

**Problem:** When recording file moves for rollback, the manifest computed `old_folder / parent_node / target_node`, but `old_folder` already included the parent node in its path. This doubled the parent node directory in the recorded destination, making rollback produce incorrect file paths. Any rollback attempt would move files to non-existent doubled directories.

**Fix:** Changed to use `src_folder.parent / parent_node / target_node` so the parent node appears exactly once in the path.

---

### BUG-048 🔴 FIXED — LLM Redistribution Node IDs Not Validated Against Proposal

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `_redistribute_with_llm()` (line ~1589)

**Problem:** When the LLM assigns excerpts to new sub-nodes during redistribution, the returned `node_id` was accepted without checking whether it exists in the proposal's `new_nodes` list. If the LLM hallucinated a node ID not in the proposal, the excerpt would be assigned to a non-existent node, creating an orphan during the apply step.

**Fix:** Built a `valid_node_ids` set from the proposal's `new_nodes`. Any LLM response with a `node_id` not in this set is flagged for human review instead of silently accepted.

---

### BUG-049 🔴 FIXED — Multi-Volume Positional Map Used Full Pages List

**Location:** `tools/discover_structure.py` → `run_structure_discovery()` (line ~2525)

**Problem:** In multi-volume books, HTML div position-to-page mapping was built from the full `pages` list regardless of volume. Since each volume's HTML has its own div ordering (starting from 0), mapping against the full list caused div positions from Volume 2 to map to Volume 1 pages. This produced incorrect `seq_index` assignments for all headings in non-first volumes.

**Fix:** Filter pages to current volume before passing to `pass1_extract_html_headings()`: `vol_pages = [p for p in pages if p.volume == vol_num]`.

---

### BUG-050 🟡 FIXED — Pass 3 Integration Crashes Kill Entire Pipeline

**Location:** `tools/discover_structure.py` → `run_structure_discovery()` (line ~2764)

**Problem:** If `integrate_pass3_results()` or `build_hierarchical_tree()` raised any exception (invalid LLM response, schema mismatch, etc.), the entire structure discovery run crashed with no output. All progress from Pass 1 and Pass 2 was lost. There was no fallback to the deterministic tree builder.

**Fix:** Wrapped Pass 3 integration + hierarchical tree build in try-except. On failure, falls back to `build_division_tree()` (deterministic, no LLM dependency) and logs a warning. The pipeline produces output (possibly lower quality) instead of crashing.

---

### BUG-051 🔴 FIXED — Empty API Choices Array Not Validated

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → OpenRouter and OpenAI response handling

**Problem:** After calling OpenRouter or OpenAI APIs, the code accessed `data["choices"][0]` without checking if the `choices` array was non-empty. Some API errors return `{"choices": []}` or omit the key entirely. This caused `IndexError` crashes mid-extraction, losing progress on the current passage.

**Fix:** Added explicit validation: `choices = data.get("choices", []); if not choices: raise RuntimeError(...)`. Applied to both OpenRouter and OpenAI code paths.

---

### BUG-052 🟡 FIXED — Empty Atom IDs Pollute Duplicate Tracking

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()` Check 8

**Problem:** When checking for duplicate atom references across excerpts, the code called `_extract_atom_id(entry)` but didn't handle the case where it returns an empty string. Empty IDs were tracked in `core_seen` and `ctx_seen` dicts, causing false duplicate warnings when multiple entries had missing IDs. This injected noise into validation reports.

**Fix:** Added `if not aid: continue` guard before tracking atom IDs in duplicate detection.

---

### BUG-053 🔴 FIXED — Consensus Engine Produced Invalid Confidence Value "discard"

**Location:** `tools/consensus.py` → arbiter resolution (line ~1341)

**Problem:** When the arbiter decided not to keep an unmatched excerpt, the confidence was set to `"discard"` — a value not in the valid set `{"high", "medium", "low"}`. Any downstream code checking `confidence == "low"` to flag uncertain results would miss these entries entirely. The invalid value also violated the implicit schema contract documented in EXCERPT_DEFINITION.md.

**Fix:** Changed `"discard"` to `"low"` — rejected unmatched excerpts get low confidence, which correctly flags them for human review.

---

### BUG-054 🟢 FIXED — Dead Variable `skip_val` in Optimal Assignment

**Location:** `tools/consensus.py` → `_optimal_assignment()` DP reconstruction (line ~331)

**Problem:** During DP reconstruction in the bitmask assignment algorithm, the variable `skip_val = dp(row + 1, used)` was computed but never read. The reconstruction logic immediately computed `optimal_from_here = dp(row, used)` and compared against column assignments. The dead variable added unnecessary DP calls, wasting computation on every assignment reconstruction.

**Fix:** Removed the dead `skip_val` computation.

---

### BUG-055 🟡 FIXED — Cross-Validate KeyError on Empty Reports

**Location:** `tools/cross_validate.py` → `run_placement_validation()`, `run_self_containment()`, `run_cross_book()` (lines ~703-731)

**Problem:** When cross-validation found no extraction data, it returned `{"status": "no_data"}`. The CLI printing code then tried to access `report['agreements']`, `report['disagreements']`, etc., causing `KeyError`. This crashed the cross-validation tool with an unhelpful traceback instead of a clean "no data found" message.

**Fix:** Added status checks before accessing report-specific keys. When `status == "no_data"`, prints an informational message instead of crashing.

---

### BUG-056 🔴 FIXED — Taxonomy Modification Silently No-Ops When Parent Node Missing

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `_modify_v0_yaml()`, `_modify_v1_yaml()`, `_add_node_v0()`, `_add_node_v1()`

**Problem:** When the parent node ID specified in a proposal didn't exist in the taxonomy, these functions returned the data unmodified with no error or warning. The caller (`apply_proposal_to_yaml`) had no way to detect the failure, so it would bump the taxonomy version, update the registry, and proceed with redistribution — all against a taxonomy that wasn't actually modified.

**Fix:** All four functions now return `(data, found)` tuples. The caller checks `found` and prints a warning when a parent node is not located. Version bump still occurs (proposals may have mixed results) but the operator gets a clear diagnostic.

---

### BUG-057 🔴 FIXED — `_modify_v1_yaml` Overwrites Existing Children

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `_modify_v1_yaml()` (line ~1359)

**Problem:** When converting a leaf to a branch in v1 format, the function unconditionally set `node["children"] = children` with only the new nodes. If the node had any pre-existing children (edge case: malformed but recoverable state), they were silently destroyed. By contrast, `_add_node_v1` correctly used `node.get("children", [])` and appended.

**Fix:** Changed to `children = node.get("children", [])` then append new nodes, consistent with `_add_node_v1`.

---

### BUG-058 🔴 FIXED — `replay_correction` Calls `run_extraction` With Wrong Signature

**Location:** `tools/human_gate.py` → `replay_correction()` (lines 312-338)

**Problem:** The function called `run_extraction()` with keyword arguments (`passages_path=`, `pages_path=`, etc.), but `run_extraction()` takes a single `argparse.Namespace` parameter. This crashed with `TypeError` on every real invocation. Additionally, `correction_context` was passed as a parameter but `run_extraction` had no mechanism to use it. The testing path (mock function) worked fine, which is why the test suite didn't catch this.

**Fix:** Build an `argparse.Namespace` object with all required attributes and pass it to `run_extraction()`. The `correction_context` attribute is included for future use when extraction prompt injection is implemented.

---

### BUG-059 🟡 FIXED — Correction ID Collision at Second Precision

**Location:** `tools/human_gate.py` → `create_correction_record()` (lines 110-112)

**Problem:** Auto-generated correction IDs used second-precision timestamps (`%Y%m%d%H%M%S`). Two corrections for the same excerpt within the same second would get identical IDs, making the second one unreachable via `find_correction_by_id`. Additionally, `datetime.now()` was called twice (once for ID, once for timestamp field), producing potentially different values.

**Fix:** Use microsecond precision (`%Y%m%d%H%M%S%f`) and capture `datetime.now()` once for both ID and timestamp.

---

### BUG-060 🟡 FIXED — `load_checkpoint` Accepts Corrupt JSON Without Validation

**Location:** `tools/human_gate.py` → `load_checkpoint()` (lines 553-566)

**Problem:** If the checkpoint file contained corrupt JSON (e.g., a list instead of a dict, or a dict missing the `"excerpts"` key), the function returned the parsed data as-is. Downstream code like `update_checkpoint` directly accessed `checkpoint["excerpts"]`, causing `KeyError` or `TypeError` crashes.

**Fix:** Added validation — checks that loaded data is a dict with an `"excerpts"` key that is also a dict. Returns default empty checkpoint on validation failure.

---

### BUG-061 🟡 FIXED — `validate_gold.py` Missing `--skip-checkpoint-state-check` Argument

**Location:** `tools/validate_gold.py` → argparse setup (line ~1755)

**Problem:** The code used `getattr(args, "skip_checkpoint_state_check", False)` to check for this flag, but the argument was never added to the argparse parser. The `getattr` default meant the flag was always `False` — users could never skip checkpoint state checks from the CLI despite the feature being referenced in the codebase.

**Fix:** Added `parser.add_argument("--skip-checkpoint-state-check", action="store_true")`.

---

### BUG-062 🟡 FIXED — Baseline Dir Regex Mismatch Between Validators

**Location:** `tools/validate_gold.py` → `_parse_baseline_dirs()` (line 154); `tools/run_all_validations.py` → `parse_baseline_dirs()` (line 34)

**Problem:** `validate_gold.py` used regex `passage\d+_v[0-9.]+` (only digits and dots in version), while `run_all_validations.py` used `passage\d+_v[0-9][0-9A-Za-z._+\-]*` (letters, plus, dash allowed). Baseline directories with non-numeric version suffixes (e.g., `passage4_v0.3.13_plus1`) were found by one tool but not the other, causing inconsistent validation results.

**Fix:** Harmonized both to use the more permissive regex from `run_all_validations.py`.

---

### BUG-063 🟡 FIXED — `validate_structure.py` Fabricates Phantom Page Indices

**Location:** `tools/validate_structure.py` → `load_page_indices()` (lines 44-49)

**Problem:** When a page record in JSONL lacked `seq_index`, the code used `len(indices)` as a fallback — a fabricated value that didn't correspond to any real page. This polluted the validation set with phantom indices and could mask missing-page errors. Empty lines also caused `json.JSONDecodeError`.

**Fix:** Skip records without `seq_index` instead of fabricating values. Skip empty lines before JSON parsing.

---

### BUG-064 🟡 FIXED — `pipeline_gold.py` Windows Path Backslash Inconsistency

**Location:** `tools/pipeline_gold.py` → artifact path recording (lines 222, 323-327, 459-463)

**Problem:** Artifact paths stored in `checkpoint_state.json` used `os.path.relpath()` which returns backslash-separated paths on Windows. But `checkpoint_index_lib.py` normalizes paths to forward slashes. This mismatch caused artifact path comparisons to fail on Windows.

**Fix:** Added `.replace("\\", "/")` to all `os.path.relpath()` calls used for artifact recording. Also fixed a no-op ternary in `baseline_version` extraction that returned the same value on both branches.

---

### BUG-065 🔴 FIXED — `assemble_excerpts.py` v0 Parser Ignores `_label` for Node Titles

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` → `_parse_v0()` (line 177 + line 196)

**Problem:** The v0 taxonomy parser used the raw node_id (e.g., `al_hamza`) as the title for every node, ignoring the `_label` field that carries the Arabic display name (e.g., `الهمزة`). This caused `taxonomy_path` in assembled excerpts to contain Latin IDs instead of Arabic titles (e.g., `imlaa > al_hamza > ...` instead of `إملاء > الهمزة > ...`). The root title was hardcoded to `science` name regardless of `_label`.

**Fix:** Read `_label` from each node dict for title fallback: `title = value.get("_label", key)`. For root: `root_title = root_data.get("_label", science)`.

---

### BUG-066 🔴 FIXED — `evolve_taxonomy.py` `redistribute_excerpts` Reads Wrong Field Names

**Location:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py` → `redistribute_excerpts()` (line ~1633)

**Problem:** The function read `arabic_text` and `text` from excerpt files, but assembled excerpts use `full_text` and `core_text`. This meant the LLM redistribution prompt received empty text for all assembled excerpts, making redistribution decisions effectively random.

**Fix:** Priority chain: `full_text` → `core_text` → `arabic_text` → `text`, covering both assembled and raw extraction formats.

---

### BUG-067 🟡 FIXED — `assemble_excerpts.py` `taxonomy_path` Only Updated on Normalization

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` → `assemble_matn_excerpt()` and `assemble_footnote_excerpt()`

**Problem:** The authoritative `taxonomy_path` from the parsed YAML tree was only applied when `normalize_node_id()` changed the node ID. If the node ID was already correct, the LLM-provided `taxonomy_path` was kept, which could be wrong or use different Arabic phrasing than the canonical tree.

**Fix:** Always use the authoritative `taxonomy_path` from the parsed tree, regardless of whether the node ID was normalized.

---

### BUG-068 🟡 FIXED — `assemble_excerpts.py` Duplicate Node IDs Silently Overwrite

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` → `_parse_v0()` and `_parse_v1()`

**Problem:** When a taxonomy YAML had duplicate node IDs (e.g., two siblings each with a child named `overview`), later entries silently overwrote earlier ones in the result dict. No warning was emitted, causing excerpts to be placed in the wrong folder.

**Fix:** Added duplicate detection in both parsers with stderr warning: `WARNING: duplicate taxonomy node_id '{nid}'`.

---

### BUG-069 🟢 FIXED — `assemble_excerpts.py` KNOWN_SCIENCES Missing `aqidah`

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` → `KNOWN_SCIENCES` set

**Problem:** عقيدة (aqidah) was E2E-tested and had its own taxonomy (v0.1, v0.2) but wasn't in `KNOWN_SCIENCES`, causing a spurious warning during assembly runs.

**Fix:** Added `"aqidah"` to the set.

---

### BUG-070 🟢 FIXED — `assemble_excerpts.py` No Error Handling for Corrupted JSON

**Location:** `tools/assemble_excerpts.py` → `load_extraction_files()` and `load_intake_metadata()`

**Problem:** Corrupted extraction JSON files (e.g., truncated writes, encoding errors) caused unhandled `json.JSONDecodeError`, crashing the entire assembly run instead of skipping the bad file.

**Fix:** Wrapped JSON loading in try/except with warning message and continue.

---

### BUG-071 🔴 FIXED — `cross_validate.py` Checks `author_name` but Assembly Produces `author`

**Location:** `tools/cross_validate.py` → `_check_fields_algorithmic()` (line 372)

**Problem:** The self-containment check looked for `author_name` but `assemble_excerpts.py` writes the field as `author`. Combined with an `and` condition requiring `book_title` also missing, this partially masked the issue but made the author check unreliable.

**Fix:** Check both `author` and `author_name` fields. Made the author check independent of book_title.

---

### BUG-072 🔴 FIXED — `cross_validate.py` `source_pages` Check Always Fails on Assembled Excerpts

**Location:** `tools/cross_validate.py` → `_check_fields_algorithmic()` (line 382)

**Problem:** The algorithmic check required `source_pages` or `page_range`, but assembly stores provenance in a nested `provenance` dict with `extraction_passage_id` and `source_atoms`. Every assembled excerpt failed this check with a false positive "Missing source page reference", which then blocked the LLM self-containment check from ever running (line 443: `if model and not algo_issues`).

**Fix:** Also check `provenance.extraction_passage_id` and `provenance.source_atoms` as valid source references.

---

### BUG-073 🟡 FIXED — `consensus.py` `prefer_model` Not Validated Against Actual Model Names

**Location:** `tools/consensus.py` → `build_consensus()` (line 1153)

**Problem:** If `prefer_model` was set to a typo (e.g., `claude-sonet` instead of `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`), `winning` was silently set to the wrong string, causing all subsequent model selection logic to use `result_b` regardless of intent.

**Fix:** Validate `prefer_model` against `(model_a, model_b)`. If mismatched, emit warning and fall back to issue-count-based selection.

---

### BUG-074 🟡 FIXED — `consensus.py` Enrichment Mutates Original Model Results

**Location:** `tools/consensus.py` → `build_consensus()` (line 1234)

**Problem:** In the full agreement path, `exc = m["excerpt_a"]` gave a direct reference into the original model result. Enrichment then mutated this dict in place via `exc[field] = other_val`. If downstream code re-examined the per-model results after consensus, it would see unexpectedly modified data.

**Fix:** Shallow copy the excerpt before enriching: `exc = dict(m["excerpt_a"] if ...)`.

---

### BUG-075 🟡 FIXED — `extract_passages.py` Validation Check 10 Mutates Data During Validation

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `validate_extraction()` (lines 1277-1295)

**Problem:** The taxonomy_node_id normalization (dot-path/colon-path → leaf ID) was performed inside `validate_extraction`, which should be a pure reporting function. This meant validation had side effects, making it non-idempotent and causing the normalization to be entangled with the validation report.

**Fix:** Moved normalization to `post_process_extraction` where other normalizations happen. Validation now only reports non-leaf placement.

---

### BUG-076 🟡 FIXED — `extract_passages.py` Missing Defaults for `excerpt_kind` and `taxonomy_path`

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `post_process_extraction()` (line ~1039)

**Problem:** `post_process_extraction` set defaults for many fields but omitted `excerpt_kind` and `taxonomy_path`. If the LLM omitted these, they silently became absent in the output. Assembly would get empty taxonomy_path fallback (no harm) but `excerpt_kind` would be missing from the assembled excerpt.

**Fix:** Added `exc.setdefault("excerpt_kind", "teaching")` and `exc.setdefault("taxonomy_path", "")`.

---

### BUG-077 🟡 FIXED — `extract_passages.py` `_normalize_atom_entries` Mutates Original Dicts

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `_normalize_atom_entries()` (line 973)

**Problem:** `entry.setdefault("role", default_role)` mutated the original LLM output dict in place. In consensus mode, both the raw saved output and the post-processed output could point to the same dict objects.

**Fix:** Copy the dict before modifying: `entry_copy = dict(entry)`.

---

### BUG-078 🟡 FIXED — `extract_passages.py` `httpx.PoolTimeout` Not Caught in Retry Logic

**Location:** `tools/extract_passages.py` → `call_llm()`, `call_llm_openrouter()`, `call_llm_openai()` (lines 623, 737, 835)

**Problem:** Retry handlers caught `ConnectError`, `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout` but not `PoolTimeout` (connection pool exhaustion). On long-running extraction jobs, pool exhaustion can occur since each call creates a fresh httpx client.

**Fix:** Added `httpx.PoolTimeout` to the retry exception tuple in all three API call functions.

---

### BUG-079 🟡 FIXED — `cross_validate.py` `no_data` Reports Missing Standard Keys

**Location:** `tools/cross_validate.py` → `validate_placement()`, `validate_self_containment()`, `validate_cross_book_consistency()`

**Problem:** When there was no data, functions returned `{"status": "no_data", "results": []}` missing standard keys like `agreements`, `total_excerpts`, etc. Programmatic consumers (e.g., human_gate) accessing these keys would get `KeyError`.

**Fix:** Added zeroed standard keys to all three no_data returns.

---

### BUG-080 🟡 FIXED — `cross_validate.py` Empty `book_id` Treated as Valid Book

**Location:** `tools/cross_validate.py` → `validate_cross_book_consistency()` (line 566)

**Problem:** `book_ids = set(e.get("book_id", "") for e in excerpts)` treated empty string as a valid book ID, skewing multi-book detection.

**Fix:** Filter out empty values: `book_ids = ... - {""}`.

---

### BUG-081 — 🔴 CRITICAL — evolve_taxonomy.py: proposal_map clobbers unmapped proposals — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `generate_review_md` built `proposal_map` keyed by `signal.node_id`. All unmapped signals share `node_id="_unmapped"`, so only the last proposal survived. Other unmapped signals showed "No change needed" even though proposals were generated.

**Fix:** Key by `id(signal)` instead of `signal.node_id`, and lookup with `proposal_map.get(id(signal))`.

---

### BUG-082 — 🔴 CRITICAL — evolve_taxonomy.py: parent_node_id from unvalidated nodes — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `propose_evolution_for_signal` extracted `parent_node_id` from `new_nodes_raw[0]` (the unvalidated list). If the first proposed node was rejected during validation, the proposal would use the wrong parent.

**Fix:** Changed to `validated_nodes[0].get("parent_node_id", "")`.

---

### BUG-083 — 🔴 CRITICAL — discover_structure.py: human_override assigns str to Optional[dict] — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `apply_overrides` assigned strings like `"rejected by human"` to `DivisionNode.human_override` typed as `Optional[dict]`. Downstream code using `.get()` or `["key"]` on the field would crash.

**Fix:** Wrapped all assignments in dict: `{"action": "rejected", "notes": ov.get("notes", "rejected by human")}`.

---

### BUG-084 — 🔴 CRITICAL — discover_structure.py: Phase 5 overwrites review_flags — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `build_hierarchical_tree` Phase 5 replaced `div.review_flags` with a new list, destroying any flags set during earlier phases (e.g., `"same_page_cluster"`).

**Fix:** Changed to extend existing flags with deduplication (check `not in div.review_flags` before appending).

---

### BUG-085 — 🟡 MODERATE — discover_structure.py: page_hint_end format inconsistency — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `page_hint_end` in `build_hierarchical_tree` used format `"ج{volume}:ص:{page}"` with raw int volume, while `make_page_hint` used `"ج{indic_volume} ص:{indic_page}"`. Different formats between `page_hint_start` and `page_hint_end`.

**Fix:** Use `make_page_hint(end_page.volume, end_page.page_number_int, multi_volume=True)` consistently.

---

### BUG-086 — 🟡 MODERATE — discover_structure.py: max() on empty pages crashes — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Four call sites used `max(p.seq_index for p in pages)` without `default=0`, which would raise `ValueError` on empty page lists.

**Fix:** Added `default=0` to all four `max()` calls.

---

### BUG-087 — 🟡 MODERATE — discover_structure.py: cross_reference_toc None page_number — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `cross_reference_toc` performed `toc.page_number + offset` without checking for None, but `TOCEntry.page_number` is typed `Optional[int]`.

**Fix:** Added `if toc.page_number is None: continue` guard with appropriate miss recording.

---

### BUG-088 — 🟡 MODERATE — discover_structure.py: heading_text_boundary=0 falsy — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Check `if h.heading_text_boundary and ...` treated boundary position 0 as falsy, falling through to the wrong branch.

**Fix:** Changed to `if h.heading_text_boundary is not None and ...`.

---

### BUG-089 — 🔴 CRITICAL — assemble_excerpts.py: distribute_excerpts mutates input — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `distribute_excerpts` modified caller's excerpt dicts in-place when normalizing compound taxonomy_node_id paths.

**Fix:** Create a shallow copy (`exc = dict(exc)`) before mutation when normalization is needed.

---

### BUG-090 — 🟡 MODERATE — assemble_excerpts.py: same-book dupe detection too broad — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Same-book duplicate detection flagged all multi-excerpt nodes including `_unmapped` and empty-string nodes, producing noisy false positives.

**Fix:** Skip `_unmapped` and empty-string nodes in the duplicate check.

---

### BUG-091 — 🔴 CRITICAL — test_assembly.py: swapped args in BUG-043 tests — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Three test calls to `distribute_excerpts` had `output_dir` and `science` arguments swapped (string "aqidah" as output_dir, tmp_path as science).

**Fix:** Corrected to `str(tmp_path), "aqidah"` order matching the function signature.

---

### BUG-092 — 🔴 CRITICAL — human_gate.py: replay false "completed" status — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `run_extraction` returns None (no return statement). `replay_correction` used `isinstance(result, dict)` guard that always falls through to `"completed"`, hiding any actual failures.

**Fix:** Added try/except around `run_extraction`, detect None return explicitly, report `"extraction_returned_none"` status.

---

### BUG-093 — 🟡 MODERATE — human_gate.py: per-excerpt timestamps in checkpoint init — **FIXED**

**Problem:** `initialize_checkpoint_from_extraction` generated a separate `datetime.now()` for each excerpt, producing microsecond-different timestamps that falsely suggest different initialization times.

**Fix:** Capture single `now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()` before the loop.

---

### BUG-094 — 🔴 CRITICAL — intake.py: verify_intake registry check conflated — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Registry consistency check (check 6) used `all("WARN" in i or "SKIP" in i for i in issues)` which included issues from ALL previous checks. A failure in check 4 would cause check 6 to not increment `checks_passed` even if the registry was perfectly consistent.

**Fix:** Track registry-specific issues in separate `reg_issues` list and evaluate independently.

---

### BUG-095 — 🟡 MODERATE — normalize_shamela.py: duplicate FN_BOUNDARY regex — **FIXED**

**Problem:** Identical `FN_BOUNDARY` regex was compiled inside both `detect_fn_section_format` and `parse_footnotes` functions. If one was updated but not the other, detection and parsing could disagree.

**Fix:** Hoisted to module-level `FN_BOUNDARY_RE` constant, referenced by both functions.

---

### BUG-096 — 🟡 MODERATE — Retry stopping criterion conflates errors and warnings [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/extract_passages.py` (lines 1718–1724)
**Found:** Audit 13 (2026-03-01) — code review of extract_passages.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** The retry loop's "no improvement" check used `n_issues = len(errors) + len(warnings)` — treating errors and warnings as interchangeable. If a correction converted 1 error + 2 warnings into 0 errors + 3 warnings (same total), the loop stopped prematurely with "No improvement" even though the blocking error was resolved.

**Fix:** Compare errors and warnings independently. Stop only if errors didn't decrease, or if errors stayed the same AND warnings didn't decrease.

### BUG-097 — 🟡 MODERATE — repair_truncated_json leaves trailing comma before closing brackets [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/extract_passages.py` (lines 578–590)
**Found:** Audit 13 (2026-03-01) — code review of extract_passages.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** After closing unclosed brackets/braces from the stack, a trailing comma could remain before the first closing bracket (e.g., `"bar"}, ]`). `json.loads` rejects this, causing `RuntimeError` and passage data loss when truncation lands after a complete JSON object followed by a comma inside an array.

**Fix:** Added a final `re.sub(r',(\s*[}\]])', r'\1', repair)` pass to strip trailing commas introduced by stack closing.

### BUG-098 — 🟡 MODERATE — _extract_taxonomy_context deduplicates by content not position [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/consensus.py` (lines 1087–1096)
**Found:** Audit 13 (2026-03-01) — code review of consensus.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** The taxonomy context deduplication used raw line content as the uniqueness key. YAML taxonomy files have many structurally identical lines (`_leaf: true`, `children:`, etc.). When two nodes' context windows both contained lines with identical content, the second occurrence was silently dropped — giving the arbiter an incomplete view of the taxonomy, especially for sibling leaf nodes (the most common arbiter scenario).

**Fix:** Changed deduplication from content-based to position-based (`seen_line_indices` set), preserving all structurally identical lines from different nodes while still deduplicating overlapping windows.

### BUG-099 — 🔴 CRITICAL — _resolve_excerpt_text joins atoms with single newline [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/cross_validate.py` (line 172)
**Found:** Audit 14 (2026-03-01) — code review of cross_validate.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** `_resolve_excerpt_text` joined atom texts with `"\n"` (single newline) instead of `"\n\n"` (double newline). Arabic paragraph boundaries were lost, producing a run-on text block that misrepresented the content structure to the placement validation LLM.

**Fix:** Changed `"\n".join(parts)` to `"\n\n".join(parts)` to match the assembly tool's paragraph separator convention.

---

### BUG-100 — 🔴 CRITICAL — Self-containment LLM failure silently passes excerpt [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/cross_validate.py` (lines 458, 474–479)
**Found:** Audit 14 (2026-03-01) — code review of cross_validate.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** When `_parse_llm_json(response)` returned `None` (LLM call failed), `llm_issues` stayed as `[]` and the excerpt was marked `"pass"`. The caller could not distinguish "LLM check skipped because algo failed" from "LLM call errored out".

**Fix:** Added `else` branch after `if parsed:` that sets `llm_issues` to an error message string, ensuring the excerpt is marked `"fail"` when the LLM check was attempted but failed.

---

### BUG-101 — 🟡 MODERATE — Cross-book book_count inflated by empty book_id [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/cross_validate.py` (lines 608, 627)
**Found:** Audit 14 (2026-03-01) — code review of cross_validate.py
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** `book_count` was computed as `len(set(e.get("book_id", "") for e in excerpts))`, which counts the empty string as a distinct book — inflating the count by 1 when any excerpt has no `book_id`.

**Fix:** Pre-compute `multi_book_ids[node_id]` (filtered set excluding `""`) and use `len(multi_book_ids.get(node_id, set()))` in both result dicts.

---

### BUG-102 — 🟡 MODERATE — Cluster signal tests used atom IDs without book prefix [FIXED]
**File:** `tests/test_evolution.py` (TestSignalDetection class)
**Found:** Audit 14 (2026-03-01) — test coverage review
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** Tests for `scan_cluster_signals` used bare atom IDs like `"a1"` (no colon), so `book_id` derivation via `atom_id.split(":")[0]` returned empty string for all excerpts. Tests passed because all excerpts got the same empty book_id, not because same-book detection actually worked.

**Fix:** Changed all atom IDs in cluster tests to use proper `book:section:seq` format (e.g., `"qimlaa:matn:001"`) so the book-ID derivation path is actually exercised.

---

### BUG-103 — 🟢 LOW — Tautological TestMultiVolumePositionalMap tests [FIXED]
**File:** `tests/test_structure_discovery.py` (lines 1447–1494)
**Found:** Audit 14 (2026-03-01) — test coverage review
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** Both tests in `TestMultiVolumePositionalMap` tested inline Python list operations (list comprehension filtering, identity comparison), not any function from `discover_structure.py`. They would pass even if the multi-volume code was broken.

**Fix:** Removed the tautological tests. Multi-volume functionality is tested through the actual integration tests in `TestPass1And2Integration` and `TestPass3IntegrationFallback`.

---

### BUG-104 — 🟡 MODERATE — corpus_audit.py division by zero on empty corpus [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/corpus_audit.py` (lines 156, 202)
**Found:** Audit 15 (2026-03-01) — code review of utility tools
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** When no books process successfully (wrong `--books-dir` path, all books error), `total_pages == 0` causing `ZeroDivisionError` at line 202 (`total_zwnj/total_pages*100`) and line 156 (`total_pages/elapsed`).

**Fix:** Added guards: `if total_pages > 0` before division, `if elapsed > 0` before pages/sec calculation.

---

### BUG-105 — 🟡 MODERATE — pipeline_gold.py run_cmd UnboundLocalError [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/pipeline_gold.py` (lines 172–187)
**Found:** Audit 15 (2026-03-01) — code review of utility tools
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** If `open()` or `os.makedirs()` raised before `subprocess.run`, `res` was never assigned. After the `finally` block, `res.returncode` at line 186 raised `UnboundLocalError`, hiding the actual filesystem error.

**Fix:** Initialize `res = None` before `try`, add `if res is None: die(...)` guard after `finally`.

---

### BUG-106 — 🟡 MODERATE — validate_structure.py page range check silently passes with missing fields [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/validate_structure.py` (lines 143–154)
**Found:** Audit 15 (2026-03-01) — code review of utility tools
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** `d.get("start_seq_index", 0)` defaulted missing fields to `0`, so a division missing both fields appeared valid (0 == 0) instead of being flagged.

**Fix:** Use `None` sentinel instead of `0`; skip divisions with `None` start/end (already reported by `validate_required_fields`).

---

### BUG-107 — 🟢 LOW — run_all_validations.py file handle leak [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/run_all_validations.py` (line 58)
**Found:** Audit 15 (2026-03-01) — code review of utility tools
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** `json.load(open(md, encoding="utf-8"))` never explicitly closes the file handle. On Windows, leaked handles can block other processes.

**Fix:** Changed to `with open(...) as f: json.load(f)`.

---

### BUG-108 — 🟢 LOW — validate_gold.py _sha256_bytes reads entire file into memory [FIXED]
**File:** `tools/validate_gold.py` (lines 250–254)
**Found:** Audit 15 (2026-03-01) — code review of utility tools
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:** `f.read()` loads the entire file at once. Source HTML files (Shamela exports) can be many megabytes. Sister functions `sha256_file` in `pipeline_gold.py` and `checkpoint_index_lib.py` correctly use chunked reading.

**Fix:** Changed to chunked reading: `for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(1 << 20), b"")`.
