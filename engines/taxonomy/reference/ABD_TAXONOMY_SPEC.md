# Stage 5: Taxonomy Placement & Evolution — Specification

> ## ⚠️ SCHEMA DRIFT WARNING
>
> This spec was written before the automated tools existed. The **placement rules** (§4.1) and
> **evolution rules** (§5) are accurate. However, some **field names and ID formats** in examples
> are outdated:
>
> | What this spec says | What's actually true | Section |
> |---------------------|---------------------|---------|
> | Field `placed_at` | Actual field: `taxonomy_node_id` | §4.1 |
> | `"triggered_by_excerpt": "EXC_042"` | Actual format: `{book_id}:exc:000042` | §4.2 |
> | صرف/نحو trees "not yet created" | All 4 core science trees exist (892 leaves total) | §3 |
>
> **For authoritative schema:** `schemas/gold_standard_schema_v0.3.3.json`
> **For taxonomy evolution tool:** `tools/evolve_taxonomy.py`
> **For field definitions:** `project_glossary.md` §6

**Status:** Draft — placement rules exist; evolution mechanism underspecified
**Precision level:** Medium (placement checklists inherited; tree evolution process needs zoom-in)
**Dependencies:** Stage 4 (Excerpting) output. Requires base taxonomy trees.

## 1. Purpose

Place each excerpt into the correct leaf node of the correct science's taxonomy tree. When the existing tree doesn't have the right node, propose taxonomy changes. Manage cross-science routing.

## 3. Base Taxonomy Trees

Each science has a base taxonomy tree provided by the user. The tree is a YAML file with hierarchical nodes:

```yaml
# Example: balagha_v0_4.yaml (202 nodes, 143 leaves)
balagha:
  maani:
    khabar:
      haqiqat_al_khabar:
        _leaf: true
      kayfiyyat_ilqaa_al_khabar:
        _leaf: true
      ...
    inshaa:
      ...
  bayan:
    tashbih:
      ...
  badi:
    ...
```

**Current state:**
- إملاء: `imlaa_v1_0` active (105 leaves), `imlaa_v0.1` historical (44 leaves) ✓
- بلاغة: `balagha_v1_0` active (335 leaves), historical versions v0_2–v0_4 ✓
- صرف: `sarf_v1_0` active (226 leaves) ✓
- نحو: `nahw_v1_0` active (226 leaves) ✓
- عقيدة: `aqidah_v0_2` (28 leaves, evolved from v0.1 after E2E testing) ✓

## 4. Placement Logic

### 4.1 Normal case: excerpt maps to existing leaf

The excerpt's `taxonomy_node_id` field points to a leaf node in the appropriate science's tree.

**Validation (PLACE.P rules):**
- P.1: The target node must exist in the active taxonomy
- P.2: The target node must be a leaf (not a branch)
- P.3: The excerpt's core atoms must genuinely teach the topic defined by that node
- P.4: If the node already has excerpts from other passages, the new excerpt must be consistent (teaching the same topic, not a different interpretation of the node name)
- P.5: Placement must be specific — not a catch-all parent node when a more specific child exists
- P.6: General/introductory content follows the branch-level convention (BD §6)

### 4.2 Missing node: taxonomy change proposal

When an excerpt teaches a topic not represented in the current tree:

1. The system generates a `taxonomy_change` proposal:
```json
{
  "change_type": "node_added",
  "parent_path": "balagha/maani/khabar",
  "new_node_id": "aqsam_al_khabar",
  "new_node_title_ar": "أقسام الخبر",
  "justification": "Excerpt teaches classification of khabar types not covered by existing leaves",
  "triggered_by_excerpt": "jawahir:exc:000042"
}
```

2. Valid change types (per glossary §6): `node_added`, `leaf_granulated`, `node_renamed`, `node_moved`

3. Changes are **proposed, not applied**. They accumulate in `taxonomy_changes.jsonl`.

4. At the end of a book, the user reviews all proposed changes and approves/rejects them.

5. Approved changes are applied to create a new taxonomy version (e.g., `balagha_v0_5`).

### 4.3 Cross-science routing

When an excerpt from a بلاغة book is classified as صرف:
- The excerpt's `science_classification` is `sarf`
- The excerpt must be placed in the صرف taxonomy tree (not the بلاغة tree)
- If the صرف tree doesn't exist yet, the excerpt is stored in a pending queue until the tree is available
- The book's registry entry tracks which sciences received excerpts

### 4.4 Unrelated excerpts

Excerpts classified as `unrelated` are stored in:
```
books/{book_id}/unrelated_excerpts/
```
They are NOT placed in any taxonomy tree. They are preserved for potential future use (e.g., if a new science is added later).

---

## 5. Taxonomy Evolution Rules

**The taxonomy is alive.** Trees evolve as books reveal finer topic distinctions. The driving principle is **content sovereignty**: excerpts are king, the taxonomy tree serves them — never the reverse. If an excerpt doesn't fit the current tree, the tree changes. Content is never forced into an ill-fitting node.

### 5.1 Evolution triggers

A taxonomy change is triggered when:
- An excerpt teaches a topic not represented by any existing leaf
- Multiple excerpts from different books accumulate at the same leaf and reveal subtopic distinctions that warrant splitting
- A node name doesn't accurately describe the content placed there

**Quality signal:** When a single book contributes multiple excerpts to the same leaf, it may indicate the leaf needs granulation (splitting into sub-leaves). This is a signal to investigate, not a hard rule.

### 5.2 Evolution process

Evolution is LLM-driven with human approval:

1. **Detect need** — During extraction or post-extraction review, identify that the current tree lacks granularity
2. **Propose change** — Generate a `taxonomy_change` proposal (add leaf, split leaf, rename, move)
3. **Read Arabic text** — When redistributing excerpts after a split, the LLM must read the actual Arabic text of ALL existing excerpts at the affected node (from all books) to make accurate placement decisions
4. **Redistribute** — Assign each existing excerpt to its correct new sub-leaf based on content
5. **Human approval** — All changes are proposed, never auto-applied. The user reviews and approves/rejects
6. **Version bump** — Approved changes create a new taxonomy version with full change records

### 5.3 Cumulative growth

The taxonomy tree grows across books. Book A may add 5 leaves. Book B may add 3 more. The tree is never pruned automatically.

### 5.4 Version control

Each state of the tree is a version. Versions are immutable once sealed. Changes create new versions. Full version history is maintained for rollback capability.

### 5.5 Consistency requirement

When a new node is added, all previously placed excerpts remain valid at their current nodes. A taxonomy change must never invalidate existing placements — redistribution must account for every affected excerpt.

### 5.6 Taxonomy = folder structure

Each taxonomy YAML defines a real directory tree. The root folder is the science name (e.g., `imlaa/`). Branches become nested folders. Leaf folders (`_leaf: true`) are the endpoints where excerpt files are placed. Multiple books contribute excerpt files to the same folder tree, so a leaf folder accumulates excerpts from different authors on the same topic. The external synthesis LLM reads all excerpt files at each leaf folder to produce one encyclopedia article.

## 6. Output Artifacts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `taxonomy_changes.jsonl` | Proposed changes from this book |
| `placement_report.json` | Stats: excerpts per node, cross-science count, unrelated count |
| `taxonomy_{science}_v{N+1}.yaml` | Updated tree (after user approval) |

## 7. Open Questions (To Resolve During Zoom-In)

1. **Tree visualization:** How does the user review taxonomy changes? A diff view? A tree viewer?
2. **Merge conflicts:** If two books are processed simultaneously and both propose changes to the same branch, how are conflicts resolved?
3. **Node granularity:** When should a leaf be split into sub-leaves? What's the threshold (number of excerpts? topic diversity?)?
4. **Cross-book node reuse:** How does the system know that excerpt from Book A and excerpt from Book B should go to the same node? Matching by node ID? By semantic similarity?
