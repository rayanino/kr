### REQ-SRC-0007 — Level field preservation across source-engine handoff
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: medium
- Confidence: medium
- Source: Derived from OF-SRC-0007; moved to step 60 on 2026-04-14 because the rule governs handoff packaging rather than metadata deliberation itself.
- Trigger: The source engine packages SourceMetadata for the normalization handoff bundle.
- Postconditions:
  - The handoff payload always includes the level key.
  - A populated level value is passed through unchanged.
  - An unknown level is serialized as null rather than omitted.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [deterministic] Given tests/fixtures/shamela_real/06_usul/book.htm with SourceMetadata.level="intermediate"; When source-to-normalization handoff packaging executes; Then The serialized payload contains level="intermediate"..
  - AC-2 [deterministic] Given tests/fixtures/shamela_real/12_multi_muq/001.htm with SourceMetadata.level=null; When source-to-normalization handoff packaging executes; Then The serialized payload contains the key level with value null..

### REQ-SRC-0022 — PDF handoff preserves intake verdicts
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Added from reference/pdf_fixture_observations_2026-04-14.md and revised on 2026-04-14 so the handoff step propagates intake-analysis verdicts without performing normalization itself.
- Trigger: Source admission and normalization handoff finalize a source whose intake dossier source_format is pdf.
- Postconditions:
  - SourceMetadata.normalization_route is set to pdf_ocr_primary.
  - SourceMetadata.pdf_text_layer_status and SourceMetadata.page_count_physical are copied from the intake dossier.
  - NormalizationInput.source_format_legacy is set from SourceMetadata.source_format and SourceMetadata.pdf_text_layer_status according to the bridge contract.
  - The normalization_handoff_bundle preserves the intake dossier evidence needed to explain the PDF verdict downstream.
  - The source engine emits no normalized_text field for a PDF handoff.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [integration] Given tests/fixtures/ibn_aqil_alfiyyah/vol6.pdf; When normalization handoff packaging executes; Then SourceMetadata.normalization_route="pdf_ocr_primary", SourceMetadata.pdf_text_layer_status="absent", SourceMetadata.page_count_physical=398, NormalizationInput.source_format_legacy="pdf_scanned", and normalization_handoff_bundle contains no normalized_text field..
  - AC-2 [integration] Given tests/fixtures/waraqat_usul/waraqat.pdf; When normalization handoff packaging executes; Then SourceMetadata.normalization_route="pdf_ocr_primary", SourceMetadata.pdf_text_layer_status="corrupt", SourceMetadata.page_count_physical=13, NormalizationInput.source_format_legacy="pdf_scanned", and normalization_handoff_bundle contains no normalized_text field..
  - AC-3 [deterministic] Given A temporary PDF generated during the test run with one Arabic page containing clean embedded text; When normalization handoff packaging executes; Then SourceMetadata.normalization_route="pdf_ocr_primary", SourceMetadata.pdf_text_layer_status="clean", NormalizationInput.source_format_legacy="pdf_text", and normalization_handoff_bundle contains no normalized_text field..

### REQ-SRC-0025 — Two-stage source admission and normalization handoff packaging
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that raw uploads must not pollute the official source collection and that structurally valid but partial sources may still proceed with explicit flags.
- Trigger: Source-engine finalization runs after metadata deliberation completes for a source candidate.
- Postconditions:
  - raw_upload_record.status is set to awaiting_owner_ack, source_engine_accepted, or rejected_at_source based on the source-engine result and any live owner_submission_risk_case.
  - The official source_collection is written only when the source engine completes successfully and no live owner_submission_risk_case remains unacknowledged.
  - Structurally valid sources with completeness_status in {partial, mixed, indeterminate} may still enter the source_collection with explicit admission_reason and preserved flags.
  - Structurally invalid uploads do not create source_collection records.
  - normalization_handoff_bundle is written only for source_engine_accepted sources whose owner_submission_risk_case is absent or acknowledged, and contains SourceMetadata, NormalizationInput, FrozenMemberManifest, and preserved intake_dossier completeness and integrity verdicts.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [integration] Given tests/fixtures/shamela_real/03_fiqh/book.htm after successful metadata deliberation; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then raw_upload_record.status="source_engine_accepted", exactly one source_collection record is written, and normalization_handoff_bundle.SourceMetadata.registry_entry_id is non-empty..
  - AC-2 [deterministic] Given A structurally valid upload whose intake_dossier.completeness_status="partial"; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then one source_collection record is written with admission_reason="accepted_with_flags" and the handoff preserves completeness_status="partial"..
  - AC-3 [deterministic] Given A raw upload rejected earlier with error_code=SRC-E-EMPTY-FILE; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging would otherwise execute; Then no source_collection record is written for that submission..
  - AC-4 [deterministic] Given A source candidate with a live owner_submission_risk_case awaiting acknowledgment; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then raw_upload_record.status="awaiting_owner_ack", no source_collection record is written, and no normalization_handoff_bundle is emitted..

### REQ-SRC-0027 — Owner-submission risk gate for study-quality threats
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that any uncertainty materially affecting study quality should trigger a human gate before official admission or downstream work proceeds.
- Trigger: Source-engine finalization evaluates whether the candidate carries any uncertainty that could materially affect study quality.
- Postconditions:
  - When study_quality_risk_flags is empty, no owner_submission_risk_case is written and normal source admission may continue.
  - When study_quality_risk_flags is non-empty, owner_submission_risk_case is written with owner_ack_required=true.
  - A live owner_submission_risk_case blocks official source_collection admission and blocks normalization_handoff_bundle emission until the owner acknowledges or annotates the case.
  - The source engine may still preserve provisional analysis outputs for review while the gate remains open.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [deterministic] Given A source candidate whose intake_dossier.study_quality_risk_flags is empty; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then no owner_submission_risk_case is written..
  - AC-2 [deterministic] Given A source candidate identified as one volume of a larger work with material dependency on missing volumes; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then owner_submission_risk_case.owner_ack_required=true, source_collection admission is blocked, and normalization handoff is blocked..
  - AC-3 [deterministic] Given A readable but suspicious source whose trust or integrity uncertainty could materially mislead study; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then owner_submission_risk_case.risk_flags is non-empty and owner_submission_risk_case.gate_status="awaiting_owner_ack"..
