### CON-SRC-0003 — No existing pipeline contract is binding on the rebuild
- Type: constraint
- Layer: contracts
- Step: n/a
- Status: confirmed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from OF-SRC-0014
- Rule: Archived and legacy source-engine contracts are reference material only and cannot overrule the current atom set.

### CON-SRC-0004 — Complete SourceMetadata output schema
- Type: constraint
- Layer: contracts
- Step: n/a
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Added from adversary-review.yaml ADV-002; amended per reference/pdf_fixture_observations_2026-04-14.md, owner guidance on 2026-04-14 about exact source/work identification and staged source admission, and the architecture decision that normalization owns text extraction.
- Rule: Every source-engine accepted source emits one SourceMetadata record with non-null mandatory fields source_id, source_sha256, frozen_blob_path, registry_entry_id, title_arabic, author_output, work_output, genre, science_scope, is_multi_layer, structural_format, trust_decision, completeness_status, integrity_status, volume_count, and intake_timestamp; author_output must always contain status and positions.

### CON-SRC-0005 — Normalization handoff bundle includes a bridge input contract
- Type: constraint
- Layer: contracts
- Step: n/a
- Status: proposed
- Priority: high
- Confidence: high
- Source: Added on 2026-04-14 after contract review found that SourceMetadata alone no longer defines a runnable source→normalization boundary in the live repo.
- Rule: Every source-engine accepted source must emit a NormalizationHandoffBundle containing non-null SourceMetadata, NormalizationInput, FrozenMemberManifest, completeness_status, and integrity_status.

### DEC-SRC-0014 — Separate raw-upload tracking from official source admission
- Type: decision
- Layer: architecture
- Step: n/a
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that uploaded artifacts must not pollute the official source collection before source-engine acceptance.
- Chosen option: OPT-B — Two registries with staged admission
- Decision rationale: This preserves full upload traceability without polluting the official source collection before the source engine genuinely accepts the source.

### DEC-SRC-0015 — Normalization consumes a bridge input model, not raw SourceMetadata
- Type: decision
- Layer: architecture
- Step: n/a
- Status: proposed
- Priority: high
- Confidence: high
- Source: Added on 2026-04-14 after contract-auditor review found that the redesigned SourceMetadata surface no longer matches the live normalization boundary.
- Chosen option: OPT-B — Emit a NormalizationInput bridge inside the handoff bundle
- Decision rationale: This preserves source-engine clarity while giving normalization a concrete boundary contract that can evolve independently later.

### DEC-SRC-0016 — Owner-submission risk gate blocks admission and downstream progression
- Type: decision
- Layer: architecture
- Step: n/a
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that any uncertainty materially affecting study quality should trigger a human gate before valuable downstream work proceeds.
- Chosen option: OPT-B — Emit provisional output and block progression
- Decision rationale: This preserves pipeline-quality analysis while protecting the collection and downstream work from materially risky owner submissions.

### OF-SRC-0014 — Legacy contracts do not cap the rebuild
- Type: feedback
- Layer: evidence
- Step: n/a
- Status: confirmed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Owner interview batch 4 question 2
- Interview question: How much authority do existing pipeline contracts keep during the rebuild?
- Owner answer: All engines will be rebuilt. No existing contract is binding, and the source engine should be engineered to the best possible quality without being capped by old infrastructure.

### OF-SRC-0015 — Build source-engine teams inside the source-engine scope first
- Type: feedback
- Layer: evidence
- Step: n/a
- Status: confirmed
- Priority: medium
- Confidence: high
- Source: Owner interview batch 4 question 3
- Interview question: Where should the first agent infrastructure land?
- Owner answer: The immediate focus is the source engine. The best spec, build, and agent-team design should be created inside source-engine scope first, while reusable questions can be lifted later when downstream engines are built.

### REQ-SRC-0025 — Two-stage source admission and normalization handoff packaging
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that raw uploads must not pollute the official source collection and that structurally valid but partial sources may still proceed with explicit flags.
- Trigger: Source-engine finalization runs after metadata deliberation completes for a source candidate.
- Postconditions:
  - raw_upload_record.status is set to awaiting_owner_ack, source_engine_accepted, or rejected_at_source based on the source-engine result and any live owner_submission_risk_case.
  - The official source_collection is written only when the source engine completes successfully and no live owner_submission_risk_case remains unacknowledged.
  - Structurally valid sources with completeness_status in {partial, mixed, indeterminate} may still enter the source_collection with explicit admission_reason and preserved flags.
  - Structurally invalid uploads do not create source_collection records.
  - normalization_handoff_bundle is written only for source_engine_accepted sources whose owner_submission_risk_case is absent or acknowledged, and contains SourceMetadata, NormalizationInput, FrozenMemberManifest, and preserved intake_dossier completeness and integrity verdicts.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [integration] Given tests/fixtures/shamela_real/03_fiqh/book.htm after successful metadata deliberation; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then raw_upload_record.status="source_engine_accepted", exactly one source_collection record is written, and normalization_handoff_bundle.SourceMetadata.registry_entry_id is non-empty..
  - AC-2 [deterministic] Given A structurally valid upload whose intake_dossier.completeness_status="partial"; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then one source_collection record is written with admission_reason="accepted_with_flags" and the handoff preserves completeness_status="partial"..
  - AC-3 [deterministic] Given A raw upload rejected earlier with error_code=SRC-E-EMPTY-FILE; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging would otherwise execute; Then no source_collection record is written for that submission..
  - AC-4 [deterministic] Given A source candidate with a live owner_submission_risk_case awaiting acknowledgment; When source admission and normalization handoff packaging execute; Then raw_upload_record.status="awaiting_owner_ack", no source_collection record is written, and no normalization_handoff_bundle is emitted..

### REQ-SRC-0027 — Owner-submission risk gate for study-quality threats
- Type: requirement
- Layer: pipeline
- Step: source_admission_and_normalization_handoff
- Status: proposed
- Priority: critical
- Confidence: high
- Source: Derived from owner guidance on 2026-04-14 that any uncertainty materially affecting study quality should trigger a human gate before official admission or downstream work proceeds.
- Trigger: Source-engine finalization evaluates whether the candidate carries any uncertainty that could materially affect study quality.
- Postconditions:
  - When study_quality_risk_flags is empty, no owner_submission_risk_case is written and normal source admission may continue.
  - When study_quality_risk_flags is non-empty, owner_submission_risk_case is written with owner_ack_required=true.
  - A live owner_submission_risk_case blocks official source_collection admission and blocks normalization_handoff_bundle emission until the owner acknowledges or annotates the case.
  - The source engine may still preserve provisional analysis outputs for review while the gate remains open.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - AC-1 [deterministic] Given A source candidate whose intake_dossier.study_quality_risk_flags is empty; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then no owner_submission_risk_case is written..
  - AC-2 [deterministic] Given A source candidate identified as one volume of a larger work with material dependency on missing volumes; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then owner_submission_risk_case.owner_ack_required=true, source_collection admission is blocked, and normalization handoff is blocked..
  - AC-3 [deterministic] Given A readable but suspicious source whose trust or integrity uncertainty could materially mislead study; When the owner-submission risk gate executes; Then owner_submission_risk_case.risk_flags is non-empty and owner_submission_risk_case.gate_status="awaiting_owner_ack"..
